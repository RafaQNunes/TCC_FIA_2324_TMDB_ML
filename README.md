# Machine Learning for movies' success from The Movie Database data (TMDB).
It's my partial completion of course work on DataLab / FIA Business School, which I, Rafael de Queiroz Nunes, I use machine learning for making a prediction (classification) for movies' success. The data is from The Movie Database (TMDB).

Concepts:
- Movie success: if the revenue is twice the budget registered on platform.

Report:
- The file '[FIA][TCC] Rafael de Queiroz Nunes - Entrega 2.pdf' is in Portuguese, however has all details about this job.

Other files:
- **01. api_tmbd_import_data.ipynb**: python script for downloading the data from TMBD;
- **02. api_tmbd_treat_data.ipynb**: python script for treating and stardarzing the data from TMBD;
- **03. api_tmbd_exploratory_data.ipynb**: python script for making data exploration before applying machine learning;
- **04. api_tmbd_machine_learning.ipynb**: python script for applying machine leaning using Scikit Learn and other tools;
- **export_image.zip**: images exported from python scripts in 'export_image' folder, but here is compacted on .zip file;
- **export_tmdb_database.zip**: files exported from python scripts in 'export_tmdb_database' folder, but here is compacted on .zip file.
